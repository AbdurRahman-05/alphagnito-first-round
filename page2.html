                    A garden is full of colors, scents, plants—and insects! These six-legged bugs are
                    important to a garden. Some insects, like butterflies, help to pollinate plants.
                    Others, like ladybugs, eat insects that are harmful to plants. Some plants also
                    rely on insects to protect themselves.

                <p class="para-text">
                    Peonies (PEE-oh-neez) are sweet-smelling flowers. They grow best in bright
                    sunlight. If you look up close, you'll see that a peony has many layers of round
                    petals. These flowers also make nectar. Before peonies bloom, this nectar coats
                    the outside of the closed flowers. The closed flower is called the flower bud.
                    Insects that eat nectar, like ants, are attracted to the flower bud. Some insects
                    eat the nectar and the flower bud at the same time. This harms the peony. Ants
                    cannot survive without a food source. They defend the peony against harmful
                    insects.

                    Ants defend the peony until it has bloomed fully. In turn, the peony provides
                    food for the ant. It is an ongoing cycle that is a win-win for both flower and
                    insect.
